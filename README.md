# Connect Four Game

A gameplay example, shows the first player starting Connect Four by dropping one of his/her yellow discs into the center column of an empty game board. The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until the second player, with red discs, achieves a diagonal four in a row, and wins the game. For games where the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the games are a draw.
